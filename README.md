Ã˜lkartet - Pubs in Oslo
=======================

*(Note: Github has not arrived in 2016 yet and unicode in project names is not
supported, therefore the repository is called 'pubkartet')*

This is a little side project based on my [pub map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?hl=en_US&app=mp&mid=zf6W8e-nJh30.k5vc0Sh3Cl7Q).

It uses [servant](https://haskell-servant.github.io/) for implementing a simple
API to retrieve pubs from my pub database. This project comes with a server for
this API and a simple [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)-based interface for
displaying this map, with foreign functions to access the API generated by
servant as well.

This project is used as a demo in my [servant-talk](www.meetup.com/Oslo-Haskell/events/227107530/).
